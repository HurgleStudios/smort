## Notes

This project includes an example of how to wrap a JS app for mobile using Cordova. It is tested and the APK is currently installed on my phone. It may also be a little messy (judging from some of my filenames) and require a little untangling, it appears I was using some ".bak"-file based non-git source control at some point?
